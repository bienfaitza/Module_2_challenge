# Overview of Project

this project has the aim of comparing two years performance by
analyzing the daily performance of the stock in order to transform
raw data into information for next decision making.

 In this project
The refactored codes helps to go through all rows for workbook one
by one and make a comparison with previous or next day.
and after all analysis the codes generate a summary.

## Results of analysis

We have two separate results from two different years 2017 and 2018
by using images we show how the refractored codes generate reports of performance.

### Below image shows year 2017 performance and its runtime

# summary

In this project we start with a starter code file which means we are 
using refactoring way in order to produce the result but this method
of refactoring has some advantages and disadvantages as follows.

#### advantages

  * starter codes can give you quick idea on how you can solove a problem following the way
  codes are structured
  
  * always when you have a starting point you can easyly know the requirements of the project


#### disadvantages
 
 * refactoring codes requires much efforts because its requires to follow the style of previous developer
 * To express your logic is not easy because you're mixing your logic with the previous codes.
